Stack:

It is a datastrcuture which follows LIFO(Last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out) principle.

Operation that can be performend on a STACK:

1) Push: Adds one element to the top of stack. If stack is full, then it is said to be overflow condition.
2) POP: Removes one element from the top. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be underflow condition.
3) isEmpty : Returns true if the stack is empty
4) Peek: Returns the top element of Stack.

Time Complexity: All the above operation takes a constant O(1) time.


Stack can be implemented in two ways:

1) LinkedList
2) Arrays
